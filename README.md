# text2speech
A VBscript that uses the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI) to send TTS to a virtual audio cable (installed separately).

## Why?

Because I needed someway to talk to my friends over Discord using text-to-speech so that I wouldn't wake up someone sleeping in the same room.

## Install

1. Download and install VB-Cable Virtual Audio Device (https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)
2. Make sure the virtual cable is named "CABLE Output" in your sound settings (if not, either rename it to this or change in the script to match)
3. Set "CABLE Output" as your Input Device in Discord.
4. Run script, type message, hit enter.

NOTE: You will not hear what you type yourself unless you select "Listen to this device" in the virtual cable's properties.
